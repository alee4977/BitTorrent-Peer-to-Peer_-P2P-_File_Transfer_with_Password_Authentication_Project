This python project creates a Peer-to-Peer file transfer application to handle multiple persistent TCP connections between server and clients using C++ concurrency support and socket libraries. It implements a server program to track which clients have which chunks of the file, login and password authentication, and text parsing to develop custom application. 

This project uses skills such as C++, Concurrency Support Library, Socket Programming, Custom Application Layer Protocol.
